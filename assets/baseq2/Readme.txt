Usage:
- Extract the file to your baseq2-directory and change the name "pakOrange" 
  to "pak#" (without quotes), where # can be a number from 3 till 9.
- To disable a pakfile, simply remove it or temporarily rename it.

Description:
- New skins for all weapons, (including view-skins for the "fov 90" players),
- New skins for all items used in Deathmatch games,
- New numbers and pics for HUD.

This pak will only change the look of the weapons, items, HUD-numbers and pics.
Just the basic things to give it a different look. It won't change your console 
background, menu and crosshairs.


Notes:
- If there already is a pakfile that changes the weapons skins in your baseq2-dir,
  then make sure to give this new pakfile a higher number (or remove the old one)
  or the game will not load the new skins.
- If there already are nine pakfiles in your directory then see if you can 
  temporarily rename or remove some other (old) pakfile. (Pak0.pak contains 
  the game files and pak1.pak the Q2DM multiplayer maps.)
- With a tool like PakScape you can easily edit pakfiles to your own needs. 
  For example you can take the new weapons skins from this pakfile and add 
  them to an existing pakfile or the other way around.
